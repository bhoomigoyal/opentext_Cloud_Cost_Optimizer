RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Migrate to Free Tier for DynamoDB
   Service: DynamoDB
   Current Cost: ₹5500
   Potential Savings: ₹1100
   Type: free_tier
   Implementation Effort: low
   Risk Level: low
   Description: DynamoDB offers a free tier for new tables with up to 25 read capacity units and 25 write capacity units. Migrating to this free tier can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS
   Implementation Steps:
     - Create a new DynamoDB table with free tier settings
     - Migrate existing data to the new table
     - Update application code to use the new table

2. Optimize EC2 Instance Types
   Service: EC2
   Current Cost: ₹21000
   Potential Savings: ₹4200
   Type: optimization
   Implementation Effort: medium
   Risk Level: medium
   Description: EC2 instance types can be optimized to reduce costs. For example, downgrading from a t2.micro to a t2.nano instance can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS
   Implementation Steps:
     - Identify underutilized EC2 instances
     - Downgrade instance types to t2.nano
     - Monitor and adjust instance types as needed

3. Use Open-Source Alternative for CloudWatch
   Service: CloudWatch
   Current Cost: ₹2000
   Potential Savings: ₹400
   Type: open_source
   Implementation Effort: high
   Risk Level: high
   Description: CloudWatch can be replaced with an open-source alternative like Prometheus. This can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP
   Implementation Steps:
     - Install and configure Prometheus
     - Migrate existing CloudWatch metrics to Prometheus
     - Update application code to use Prometheus

4. Migrate to Cost-Effective Storage for S3
   Service: S3
   Current Cost: ₹12000
   Potential Savings: ₹2400
   Type: cost-effective_storage
   Implementation Effort: medium
   Risk Level: medium
   Description: S3 storage can be optimized to reduce costs. For example, using S3 Standard-IA instead of S3 Standard can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP
   Implementation Steps:
     - Identify infrequently accessed S3 objects
     - Migrate objects to S3 Standard-IA
     - Monitor and adjust storage settings as needed

5. Use Multi-Cloud Provider for CloudFront
   Service: CloudFront
   Current Cost: ₹30000
   Potential Savings: ₹6000
   Type: alternative_provider
   Implementation Effort: high
   Risk Level: high
   Description: CloudFront can be replaced with a multi-cloud provider like Cloudflare. This can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP
   Implementation Steps:
     - Configure Cloudflare as a CDN
     - Migrate existing CloudFront distributions to Cloudflare
     - Update application code to use Cloudflare

6. Right-Size Lambda Function Instances
   Service: Lambda
   Current Cost: ₹15000
   Potential Savings: ₹3000
   Type: right_sizing
   Implementation Effort: medium
   Risk Level: medium
   Description: Lambda function instances can be right-sized to reduce costs. For example, downgrading from a 128MB instance to a 64MB instance can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS
   Implementation Steps:
     - Identify underutilized Lambda functions
     - Downgrade function instances to 64MB
     - Monitor and adjust instance sizes as needed

7. Use Free Tier for RDS
   Service: RDS
   Current Cost: ₹13750
   Potential Savings: ₹2750
   Type: free_tier
   Implementation Effort: low
   Risk Level: low
   Description: RDS offers a free tier for new instances with up to 750 hours of usage. Migrating to this free tier can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS
   Implementation Steps:
     - Create a new RDS instance with free tier settings
     - Migrate existing data to the new instance
     - Update application code to use the new instance

8. Optimize CloudFront Distribution Settings
   Service: CloudFront
   Current Cost: ₹30000
   Potential Savings: ₹6000
   Type: optimization
   Implementation Effort: medium
   Risk Level: medium
   Description: CloudFront distribution settings can be optimized to reduce costs. For example, enabling compression and caching can save 20% of the current cost.
   Cloud Providers: AWS
