RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Migrate EC2 Instances to Spot Instances
   Service: EC2
   Current Cost: ₹15000
   Potential Savings: ₹3000
   Type: optimization
   Implementation Effort: medium
   Risk Level: low
   Description: Migrate EC2 instances to Spot Instances to take advantage of unused capacity and reduce costs. This can be done by identifying instances that are not critical and can be run on Spot Instances.
   Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP
   Implementation Steps:
     - Identify non-critical instances
     - Create a Spot Instance request
     - Launch the instance and monitor its performance

2. Downsize RDS Instance
